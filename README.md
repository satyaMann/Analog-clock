# Analog-clock

The Project is idea to display the clock with computer graphics.  This project just used the local time, fetching from the computer and display it on screen. This project  implements the wall clock with the round circular board and three conic geometrics which forms the different (sec, min & hour) hands.
Different colours are used to represent different hands(Sec, min& hour)hands.
And numbering also introduce which help
us to see proper time.
The 'localtime(&ltime)'  function is used to get the local time. With proper maths and conversion of the time for sec, min and hours the graphical hands are made to make movement.
